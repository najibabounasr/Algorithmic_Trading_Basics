# Algorithmic_Trading_Basics
Repository Containing Basics of Algorithmic trading. 



# Basic :

This repo will act as a simple record of my progress as I improve my knowledge surrounding programming, fintech, and algorithmic trading. This repisitory only contains basic information related to setting up a basic algorithm, using for loops and if/else statements, alongside a technical evaluation of the algorithims performance at the end. 

In essence - the steps of creating an effective algorithm are all here, but the approach is still novice. By using complimentary mathematical techniques and intrroducing further features to the program, an effective algorithm may one day be created.
